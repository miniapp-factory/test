#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image to generate.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I can update the metadata and create the logo description file.  
Please add the following file to the chat so I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I’ll supply the changes.
